# Concept

Code & Sorcery combines the educational and fun aspects of a quiz game with exciting and social qualities of an RPG-inspired multiplayer experience. Our app allows the user to create single player or multiplayer games and answer a series of questions within a certain timeframe. For the multiplayer game, the user can create a game link and share it with friends - up to 4 players can join a multiplayer game and answer questions at the same time.
